# Contributing to OpenGalea

🚀 **Welcome to OpenGalea!** Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open-source **Neuroadaptive Mixed Reality** project. OpenGalea integrates **EEG-based brainwave interactions** with **Meta Quest 3 and Unity**, and we are excited to have you join us in shaping the future of **brain-computer interfaces (BCI)** in mixed reality.  

This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project. Whether you're a **developer, researcher, designer, or enthusiast**, there's something for you!

## 🏗 Project Overview
OpenGalea is an **open-source brain-computer interface (BCI) for mixed reality (MR)**, integrating EEG signals with Meta Quest 3. Key features include:
- **Multiplayer EEG-based interactions** in shared MR spaces
- **Real-time brainwave classification** using machine learning
- **Customizable Unity-based neuroadaptive environments**
- **Affordable alternative** to commercial BCI solutions

We welcome contributions in **software, machine learning, hardware design, and UI/UX improvements**!

## 💡 How to Get Started

### 1️⃣ **Find an Issue to Work On**
- Check out our **[Open Issues](https://github.com/Caerii/OpenGalea/issues)**.
- Look for labels like:
  - `good first issue` → Beginner-friendly tasks.
  - `help wanted` → Issues where community input is needed.
  - `enhancement` → New features & improvements.
- If you're unsure, drop a comment on an issue or ask in **[Discussions](https://github.com/Caerii/OpenGalea/discussions)**!

### 2️⃣ **Set Up the Project Locally**
#### 🖥 Prerequisites:
- **Unity 2022.3+** (for MR development)
- **Meta XR SDK** (for Quest 3 integration)
- **Python 3.9+** (for ML-based EEG processing)
- **OpenBCI GUI** (for EEG data collection)

#### 🔧 Steps:
1. **Fork this repository** and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenGalea.git
   cd OpenGalea
   ```
2. **Set up Unity Project**:
   - Open **Unity Hub** → Add/Open the `OpenGalea/UnityProject` folder.
   - Import the **Meta XR SDK** package.
3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd Syncer/ML
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Test Your Setup**:
   - Run the **EEG ML pipeline**: `python main_Attention.py`
   - Open the **Unity project** and play the scene.
